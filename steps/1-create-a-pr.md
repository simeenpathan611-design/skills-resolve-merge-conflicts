Step 1: Create a pull request
Welcome to "Managing Merge Conflicts"! üëã

What is a merge conflict?: A merge conflict occurs when changes are made to the same part of the same file on two different branches. You usually find out about conflicts in a pull request so let's start by creating one.

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create a pull request
Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
We made a small change to a file in the repository in the my-resume branch.
Create a pull request setting my-resume as the head branch and main as the base branch. You can enter Resolving merge conflicts for the pull request title and body.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
